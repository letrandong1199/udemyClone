(My beginner\'s guide Build a Website from Scratch with HTML & CSS will teach you everything you need to know about HTML & CSS.)\\u00a0 Practical Hands-on Approach\\u00a0 My approach with this course, like many of my courses, is to take a practical \\"hands on\\" approach. While there will be some theory involved \\u2014 every single lesson requires you to get your hands dirty and exercise what you\'ve learned in that specific lesson. I find this to be the best approach, because you\'re able to retain much more of what you learned, and therefore, get up and running with maximizing your practical knowledge of PHP quickly!\\u00a0 Why Should I Learn PHP?\\u00a0 So \\u2014 why learn PHP? Well, PHP is a very powerful scripting language used by millions of websites. Some of the most popular websites and frameworks utilize PHP to build their dynamic websites. PHP works very well with HTML, and therefore will allow you to start coding dynamic websites quickly without having to learn some of the more complicated scripting languages out there.\\u00a0 You Will Love This Course\\u00a0 I think you\'re going to love this course, and you\'re going to especially love what you\'re going to learn. When I first started learning PHP, I couldn\'t wait to start implementing what I learned into my websites! I think you\'ll feel the same.\\u00a0 It\'s Totally Free!\\u00a0 Also, I am excited to be offering this course absolutely free for three reasons:\\u00a0 I don\'t want a purchasing decision to get in the way of you learning what I have to offer in this course.I want as many people as possible to be able access the content.I want to give you learning material so good that it should cost money.The Final Project\\u00a0 Throughout the course you will be building a handful of dynamic PHP examples, but in the last section of the course, we will build a dynamic website for a (fictional) restaurant.\\u00a0 So, I invite you to join me in learning how to Code Dynamic Websites with PHP!\\u00a0 Let\'s do this.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}}]}',

This technique allows for complete figure drawings from life in less than 45 minutes. Starting with the lines of action and large abstract shapes, the course proceeds through small shapes, negative space, value, perspective, foreshortening, edge, line, details (face, hands and feet), and drapery on the figure. The final two lectures summarize the entire technique and give two examples using it to draw complete figures in under five minutes by Reilly Method Drawing. There are also five complete demonstrations using this technique done in 4- 7 minutes of figures drawn from life in a variety of positions. The driving principal behind this course is that the \\"whole is more important than the parts\\" which is the reason that I start with a gesture drawing and build on its structure until completion with anatomy and details.

The mechanical power driving a machine constitutes the rotary motion energy of a motor shaft. Electric motors, internal-combustion motors, or turbines are the most common types of motors. The mechanical power transmission from the motor to the actuating element is accomplished by various driving gears. These include gearings, worm gearings, belt drives, chain drives, and friction gears. Some examples of actuating elements are car steering wheels, work spindles, and screw propellers of ships. This course covers the design of machine elements, in particular all common types of knuckle joint and the needed machine components. The in-depth description, including stress and strength analysis, materials, tables and assembly recommendations allows for a comprehensive and detailed calculation and design of these most important.

Most of them are complete beginners when I start working with them.The previous 2 bootcamp programs that I taught cost $14,000 and $21,000.\\u00a0 This course is just as comprehensive but with brand new content for a fraction of the price.Everything I cover is up-to-date and relevant to 2021\'s developer job market. This course does not cut any corners. I just spent 8 months redoing this behemoth of a course! We build 13+ projects, including a gigantic production application called YelpCamp.

Super in-depth, with great challenges and projects that will solidify your Javascript understanding. I found the lectures were paced perfectly -- Jonas doesn\'t skip over anything that might be useful to a JS developer\\" \\u2014 Carson BartholomewJavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world. It powers the entire modern web. It provides millions of high-paying jobs all over the world.That\'s why you want to learn JavaScript too. And you came to the right place!Why is this the right JavaScript course for you?This is the most complete JavaScript course on Udemy. It\'s an all-in-one package that will take you from the very fundamentals of JavaScript, all the way to building modern and complex applications.You will learn modern JavaScript from the very beginning, step-by-step. I will guide you through practical and fun code examples, important theory about how JavaScript works behind the scenes, and beautiful and complete projects.You will also learn how to think like a developer, how to plan application features, how to architect your code, how to debug code, and a lot of other real-world skills that you will need on your developer job.And unlike other courses, this one actually contains beginner, intermediate, advanced, and even expert topics, so you don\'t have to buy any other course in order to master JavaScript from the ground up!But... You don\'t have to go into all these topics. This is a huge course, because, after all, it\'s \\"The Complete JavaScript Course\\". In fact, it\'s like many courses in one! But you can become an excellent developer by watching only parts of the course. That\'s why I built this course in a very modular way, and designed pathways that will take you through the course faster.By the end of the course, you will have the knowledge and confidence that you need in order to ace your job interviews and become a professional developer.Why am I the right JavaScript teacher for you?My name is Jonas, I\'m an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy\'s top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2016 to over 400,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.Recently, I took all my teaching experience to build this new and greatly improved JavaScript course. It\'s now the best and most in-depth JavaScript course that you will find on Udemy (and maybe the entire internet).I know how students learn JavaScript and what they need in order to master it. And with that knowledge, I designed the ideal course curriculum. It\'s a unique blend of real-world projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges, that will take you from zero to an expert and confident JavaScript developer in just a couple of weeks.So what exactly is covered in the course?Build 5 beautiful real-world projects for your portfolio! In these projects, you will learn how to plan and architect your applications using flowcharts and common JavaScript patternsMaster the JavaScript fundamentals: variables, if/else, operators, boolean logic, functions, arrays, objects, loops, strings, and moreLearn modern JavaScript (ES6+) from the beginning: arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator, default arguments, optional chaining (ES2020), and moreHow JavaScript works behind the scenes: engines, the call stack, hoisting, scoping, the \'this\' keyword, reference values, and more.Deep dive into functions: arrow functions, first-class and higher-order functions, bind, and closures.Deep dive into object-oriented programming: prototypal inheritance, constructor functions (ES5), classes (ES6), encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

It is digital, programming-oriented, and analytical. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has been surging in the job marketplace.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0However, supply has been very limited. It is difficult to acquire the skills necessary to be hired as a data scientist.\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0And how can you do that? \\u00a0 Universities have been slow at creating specialized data science programs. (not to mention that the ones that exist are very expensive and time consuming)\\u00a0 \\u00a0Most online courses focus on a specific topic and it is difficult to understand how the skill they teach fit in the complete picture \\u00a0 The Solution\\u00a0 \\u00a0Data science is a multidisciplinary field. It encompasses a wide range of topics.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Understanding of the data science field and the type of analysis carried out \\u00a0 Mathematics \\u00a0 Statistics\\u00a0 \\u00a0Python\\u00a0 \\u00a0Applying advanced statistical techniques in Python\\u00a0 \\u00a0Data Visualization \\u00a0 Machine Learning \\u00a0 Deep Learning \\u00a0 Each of these topics builds on the previous ones. And you risk getting lost along the way if you don\\u2019t acquire these skills in the right order. For example, one would struggle in the application of Machine Learning techniques before understanding the underlying Mathematics. Or, it can be overwhelming to study regression analysis in Python before knowing what a regression is.\\u00a0 \\u00a0So, in an effort to create the most effective, time-efficient, and structured data science training available online, we created The Data Science Course 2021.\\u00a0 \\u00a0We believe this is the first training program that solves the biggest challenge to entering the data science field \\u2013 having all the necessary resources in one place. \\u00a0 Moreover, our focus is to teach topics that flow smoothly and complement each other. The course teaches you everything you need to know to become a data scientist at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs (not to mention the amount of time you will save).\\u00a0 \\u00a0The Skills\\u00a0 \\u00a01.\\u00a0Intro to Data and Data ScienceBig data, business intelligence, business analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We know these buzzwords belong to the field of data science but what do they all mean?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0Why learn it?\\nAs a candidate data scientist, you must understand the ins and outs of each of these areas and recognise the appropriate approach to solving a problem. This \\u2018Intro to data and data science\\u2019 will give you a comprehensive look at all these buzzwords and where they fit in the realm of data science.\\n\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a02. Mathematics\\u00a0Learning the tools is the first step to doing data science. You must first see the big picture to then examine the parts in detail.\\u00a0 \\u00a0We take a detailed look specifically at calculus and linear algebra as they are the subfields data science relies on.\\u00a0 \\u00a0Why learn it? \\u00a0 Calculus and linear algebra are essential for programming in data science. If you want to understand advanced machine learning algorithms, then you need these skills in your arsenal.\\u00a0 \\u00a03. Statistics\\u00a0You need to think like a scientist before you can become a scientist. Statistics trains your mind to frame problems as hypotheses and gives you techniques to test these hypotheses, just like a scientist. \\u00a0 Why learn it? \\u00a0 This course doesn\\u2019t just give you the tools you need but teaches you how to use them. Statistics trains you to think like a scientist.\\u00a0 \\u00a04. PythonPython is a relatively new programming language and, unlike R, it is a general-purpose programming language. You can do anything with it! Web applications, computer games and data science are among many of its capabilities. That\\u2019s why, in a short space of time, it has managed to disrupt many disciplines. Extremely powerful libraries have been developed to enable data manipulation, transformation, and visualisation. Where Python really shines however, is when it deals with machine and deep learning.Why learn it?\\u00a0 \\u00a0When it comes to developing, implementing, and deploying machine learning models through powerful frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc, Python is a must have programming language. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a05. TableauData scientists don\\u2019t just need to deal with data and solve data driven problems. They also need to convince company executives of the right decisions to make. These executives may not be well versed in data science, so the data scientist must but be able to present and visualise the data\\u2019s story in a way they will understand. That\\u2019s where Tableau comes in \\u2013 and we will help you become an expert story teller using the leading visualisation software in business intelligence and data science.Why learn it?\\u00a0 \\u00a0A data scientist relies on business intelligence tools like Tableau to communicate complex results to non-technical decision makers. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a06. Advanced Statistics\\u00a0Regressions, clustering, and factor analysis are all disciplines that were invented before machine learning. However, now these statistical methods are all performed through machine learning to provide predictions with unparalleled accuracy. This section will look at these techniques in detail. \\u00a0 Why learn it? \\u00a0 Data science is all about predictive modelling and you can become an expert in these methods through this \\u2018advance statistics\\u2019 section. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a07. Machine Learning\\u00a0The final part of the program and what every section has been leading up to is deep learning. Being able to employ machine and deep learning in their work is what often separates a data scientist from a data analyst. This section covers all common machine learning techniques and deep learning methods with TensorFlow. \\u00a0 Why learn it?\\u00a0 \\u00a0Machine learning is everywhere. Companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been using machines that can learn on their own for years.

  'Description': '{"entityMap":{},"blocks":[{"key":"","text":"***\\u00a0As seen on Kickstarter ***Artificial intelligence is growing exponentially. There is no doubt about that. Self-driving cars are clocking up millions of miles, IBM Watson is diagnosing patients better than armies of doctors and Google Deepmind\'s AlphaGo beat the World champion at Go - a game where intuition plays a key role.\\n\\nBut the further AI advances, the more complex become the problems it needs to solve. And only Deep Learning can solve such complex problems and that\'s why it\'s at the heart of Artificial intelligence.\\n\\n--- Why Deep\\u00a0Learning A-Z? ---\\n\\nHere are five reasons we think Deep Learning A-Z\\u2122\\u00a0really is different, and stands out from the crowd of\\u00a0other training programs out there:\\n\\n1. ROBUST STRUCTURE\\u00a0\\n\\nThe first and most important thing we focused on is giving the course a robust structure. Deep Learning is very broad and complex and to navigate this maze you need a clear and global vision of it.\\u00a0\\n\\nThat\'s why we grouped the tutorials into two volumes, representing the two fundamental branches of Deep Learning: Supervised Deep Learning and Unsupervised Deep Learning.\\u00a0With each volume focusing on three distinct algorithms, we found that this is the best structure for mastering Deep Learning.\\n\\n2. INTUITION TUTORIALS\\n\\nSo many courses and books just bombard you with the theory, and math, and coding... But they forget to explain, perhaps, the most important part:\\u00a0why you are doing what you are doing.\\u00a0And that\'s how this course is so different. We focus on developing an intuitive\\u00a0*feel*\\u00a0for the concepts behind Deep Learning algorithms.\\n\\nWith our intuition tutorials you will be confident that you understand all the techniques on an instinctive level. And once you proceed to the hands-on coding exercises you will see for yourself how much more meaningful your experience will be.\\u00a0This is a game-changer.\\n\\n3. EXCITING PROJECTS\\n\\nAre you tired of courses based on over-used, outdated data sets?\\n\\nYes? Well then you\'re in for a treat.\\n\\nInside this class we will work on Real-World datasets, to solve Real-World business problems. (Definitely not the boring iris or digit classification datasets that we see in every course). In this course we will solve six real-world challenges:\\n\\nArtificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem\\nConvolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition\\nRecurrent\\u00a0Neural Networks to predict Stock Prices\\nSelf-Organizing Maps to investigate Fraud\\nBoltzmann Machines to create a Recomender System\\nStacked Autoencoders* to take on the challenge for the\\u00a0Netflix $1 Million prize\\n\\n*Stacked Autoencoders is a brand new technique in Deep Learning which didn\'t even exist a couple of years ago. We haven\'t seen this method explained anywhere else in sufficient depth.\\n\\n4. HANDS-ON CODING\\u00a0\\n\\nIn\\u00a0Deep Learning A-Z\\u2122 we code together with you.\\u00a0Every practical tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.\\u00a0\\n\\nIn addition, we will purposefully structure the code in such a way so that you can download it and apply it in your own projects.\\u00a0Moreover, we explain step-by-step where and how to modify the code to insert YOUR dataset, to tailor the algorithm to your needs, to get the output that you are after.\\u00a0\\n\\nThis is a course which naturally extends into your career.\\n\\n5. IN-COURSE SUPPORT\\n\\nHave you ever taken a course or read a book where you have questions but cannot reach the author?\\u00a0\\n\\nWell, this course is different. We are fully committed to making this the most disruptive and powerful Deep Learning course on the planet. With that comes a responsibility to constantly be there when you need our help.\\n\\nIn fact, since we physically also need to eat and sleep we have put together a team of professional Data Scientists to help us out. Whenever you ask a question you will get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.\\u00a0\\n\\nNo matter how complex your query, we will be there.\\u00a0The bottom line is we want you to succeed.\\u00a0\\n\\n---\\u00a0The Tools\\u00a0---\\n\\nTensorflow and Pytorch are the two most popular open-source libraries for Deep Learning. In this course you will learn both!\\n\\nTensorFlow was developed by Google and is used in their speech recognition system, in the new google photos product, gmail, google search and much more. Companies using Tensorflow include AirBnb, Airbus, Ebay, Intel, Uber and dozens more.\\u00a0\\n\\nPyTorch is as just as powerful and is being developed by researchers at Nvidia and leading universities: Stanford, Oxford, ParisTech. Companies using PyTorch include Twitter, Saleforce and Facebook.\\n\\nSo which is better and for what?\\u00a0\\n\\nWell, in this course you will have an opportunity to work with both and understand when Tensorflow is better and when PyTorch is the way to go. Throughout the tutorials we compare the two and give you tips and ideas on which could work best in certain circumstances.\\n\\nThe interesting thing is that both these libraries are barely over 1 year old. That\'s what we mean when we say that in this course we teach you the most cutting edge Deep Learning models and techniques.\\n\\n--- More\\u00a0Tools\\u00a0---\\n\\nTheano\\u00a0is another open source deep learning library. It\'s very similar to Tensorflow in its functionality, but nevertheless we will still cover it.\\n\\nKeras\\u00a0is an incredible library to implement Deep Learning models. It acts as a wrapper for Theano and Tensorflow. Thanks to Keras we can create powerful and complex Deep Learning models with only a few lines of code. This is what will allow you to have a global vision of what you are creating. Everything you make will look so clear and structured thanks to this library, that you will really get the intuition and understanding of what you are doing.\\n\\n--- Even More\\u00a0Tools\\u00a0---\\n\\nScikit-learn\\u00a0the most practical Machine Learning library. We will mainly use it: \\u00a0\\n\\nto evaluate the performance of our models with the most relevant technique, k-Fold Cross Validation\\nto improve our models with effective Parameter Tuning\\nto preprocess our data, so that our models can learn in the best conditions\\n\\nAnd of course, we have to mention the usual suspects. This whole course is based on Python and in every single section you will be getting hours and hours of invaluable hands-on practical coding experience.\\u00a0\\n\\nPlus, throughout the course we will be using\\u00a0Numpy to do high computations and manipulate high dimensional arrays,\\u00a0Matplotlib to plot insightful charts and\\u00a0Pandas to import and manipulate datasets the most efficiently.\\n\\n--- Who Is This Course For?\\u00a0---\\n\\nAs you can see, there are lots of different tools in the space of Deep Learning and in this course we make sure to show you the most important and most progressive ones so that when you\'re done with Deep Learning A-Z\\u2122 your skills are on the cutting edge of today\'s technology.\\n\\nIf you are just starting out into Deep Learning,\\u00a0then you will find this course extremely useful. Deep Learning A-Z\\u2122 is structured around special coding blueprint approaches meaning that you won\'t get bogged down in unnecessary programming or mathematical complexities and instead you will be applying Deep Learning techniques from very early on in the course.\\u00a0You will build your knowledge from the ground up and you will see how with every tutorial you are getting more and more confident.\\n\\nIf you already have experience with Deep Learning,\\u00a0you will find this course refreshing, inspiring and very practical. Inside Deep Learning A-Z\\u2122 you will master some of the most cutting-edge Deep Learning algorithms and techniques (some of which didn\'t even exist a year ago) and through this course you will gain an immense amount of valuable hands-on experience with real-world business challenges. Plus, inside you will find inspiration to explore new Deep Learning skills and applications.\\n\\n---\\u00a0Real-World Case Studies ---\\n\\nMastering Deep Learning is not just about knowing the intuition and tools, it\'s also about being able to apply these models to real-world scenarios and derive actual measurable results for the business or project. That\'s why in this course we are introducing six exciting challenges:\\n\\n#1 Churn Modelling Problem\\n\\nIn this part you will be solving a data analytics challenge for a bank. You will be given a dataset with a large sample of the bank\'s customers. To make this dataset, the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank.\\u00a0\\n\\nYour goal is to make an Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn). Besides, you are asked to rank all the customers of the bank, based on their probability of leaving. To do that, you will need to use the right Deep Learning model, one that is based on a probabilistic approach.\\u00a0\\n\\nIf you succeed in this project, you will create significant added value to the bank. By applying your Deep Learning model the bank may significantly reduce customer churn.\\n\\n#2 Image Recognition\\n\\nIn this part, you will create a Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images. We will implement this Deep Learning model to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures. However, this model can be reused to detect anything else and we will show you how to do it - by simply changing the pictures in the input folder.\\u00a0\\n\\nFor example, you will be able to train the same model on a set of brain images, to detect if they contain a tumor or not. But if you want to keep it fitted to cats and dogs, then you will literally be able to a take a picture of your cat or your dog, and your model will predict which pet you have. We even tested it out on Hadelin\\u2019s dog!\\n\\n#3\\u00a0Stock Price Prediction\\n\\nIn this part, you will create one of the most powerful Deep Learning models. We will even go as far as saying that you will create the Deep Learning model closest to\\u00a0\\u201cArtificial Intelligence\\u201d. Why is that? Because this model will have long-term memory, just like us, humans.\\u00a0\\n\\nThe branch of Deep Learning which facilitates this is Recurrent Neural Networks. Classic RNNs have short memory, and were neither popular nor powerful for this exact reason. But a recent major improvement in Recurrent Neural Networks gave rise to the popularity of LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory RNNs) which has completely changed the playing field.\\u00a0We are extremely excited to include these cutting-edge deep learning methods in our course!\\u00a0\\n\\nIn this part you will learn how to implement this ultra-powerful model, and we will take the challenge to use it to predict the real Google stock price. A similar challenge has already been faced by researchers at Stanford University and we will aim to do at least as good as them.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0#4\\u00a0Fraud Detection\\n\\nAccording to a recent report published by Markets & Markets the Fraud Detection and Prevention Market is going to be worth $33.19 Billion USD by 2021. This is a huge industry and the demand for advanced Deep Learning skills is only going to grow. That\\u2019s why we have included this case study in the course. \\u00a0\\n\\nThis is the first part of Volume 2 - Unsupervised Deep Learning Models. The business challenge here is about detecting fraud in credit card applications. You will be creating a Deep Learning model for a bank and you are given a dataset that contains information on customers applying for an advanced credit card.\\u00a0\\n\\nThis is the data that customers provided when filling the application form. Your task is to detect potential fraud within these applications. That means that by the end of the challenge, you will literally come up with an explicit list of customers who potentially cheated on their applications.\\n\\n#5 & 6 Recommender Systems\\n\\nFrom Amazon product suggestions to Netflix movie recommendations - good recommender systems are very valuable in today\'s World. And specialists who can create them are some of the top-paid Data Scientists on the planet.\\n\\nWe will work on a dataset that has exactly the same features as the Netflix dataset: plenty of movies, thousands of users, who have rated the movies they watched. The ratings go from 1 to 5, exactly like in the Netflix dataset, which makes the Recommender System more complex to build than if the ratings were simply \\u201cLiked\\u201d or \\u201cNot Liked\\u201d.\\u00a0\\n\\nYour final Recommender System will be able to predict the ratings of the movies the customers didn\\u2019t watch. Accordingly, by ranking the predictions from 5 down to 1, your Deep Learning model will be able to recommend which movies each user should watch. Creating such a powerful Recommender System is quite a challenge so we will give ourselves two shots. Meaning we will build it with two different Deep Learning models.\\n\\nOur first model will be Deep Belief Networks, complex Boltzmann Machines that will be covered in Part 5. Then our second model will be with the powerful AutoEncoders, my personal favorites. You will appreciate the contrast between their simplicity, and what they are capable of.\\n\\nAnd you will even be able to apply it to yourself or your friends. The list of movies will be explicit so you will simply need to rate the movies you already watched, input your ratings in the dataset, execute your model and voila! The Recommender System will tell you exactly which movies you would love one night you if are out of ideas of what to watch on Netflix! \\u00a0\\n\\n---\\u00a0Summary\\u00a0---\\n\\nIn conclusion, this is an exciting training program filled with intuition tutorials, practical exercises and real-World case studies.\\u00a0\\n\\nWe are super enthusiastic about Deep Learning and hope to see you inside the class!\\n\\nKirill &\\u00a0Hadelin","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}}]}',

She does a wonderful job of encouraging you to learn swift the right way. I want to encourage everyone thinking about taking this class to get it, as it is the BEST Swift programming class I\'ve seen on anywhere and I\'ve tried more than a few of them. If you are looking for an excellent swift programming course, stop there here because you have found it. You will learn Swift from the very beginning of programming all the way through making your own apps that you can upload to the App store.\\" - Ian Hopjins\\"SO GOOD!!! Retention rate is incredible because Angela does a great job in explaining and teaching every aspect of what we are doing. Most of the other instructors on Udemy put code on the screen and pretend nothing happened. This course is amazing! 5/5\\" - Muhammad Ibrahim\\"Angela is a spectacular teacher!\\" - Marco Zanirato\\"This course was terrific. Only after taking a few more courses from others that I realized how good this course was. This course taught me more than I was expecting, it provided great instructions and a lot of hands-on tasks to drill-in the concept.\\" - Marc\\"Best use of your money! I was a complete beginner but Angela made me a pro in weeks.\\" - Burak Tun\\u00e7bilek\\"IT IS #1!!!!!!!!! Absolutely Amazing. The best iOS course i have ever taken. Angela explains everything the way it needs to be explained, so everything is easily understood. The concept of this course is built to make you learn, not just watch and repeat. Angela is highly educated and it is very much noticeable during the entire course. Again, it is fantastic. Thank you. Please create more courses!!!!!\\" - Eduard KhachianAre you trying to choose between all the different iOS courses on Udemy? Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this:I have revamped my expectation for what a 5 star course should be for Udemy. Angela, you\'re awesome! I already rated the course as 5 stars early on (at about 20% completion), but after completing roughly 70% of the course, I can say this is my favourite Udemy course as of today. Brilliant course Angela! - Alberto L\\"I took a lot of courses on Udemy and elsewhere and non of them were as clear and perfectly paced as this one! Angelas approach is really awesome, deep and clear.\\" - \\u017dan Fras\\"I have taken several iOS courses, so far this course had the best explanation on swift and xcode documentation. The lecturer is kinda humorous sometimes which make this course even more enjoyable.\\" - Bryan Pukanda\\"I have taken lots of courses on udemy and elsewhere for self learning and i can tell you with all the honesty this is one course which i did not want it to end. It is like one of those movies that you wish keeps going. Whatever concepts are covered were covered very beautifully and made learning quite simple. I got so many answers to Why? in this course like how closures work and why they work that way... why delegates work that way. Thank you so much for this course.\\" - Arun Lakhera\\"I compare this to another top iOS class on Udemy, but I think that this one beats it. The reason? Angela doesn\'t show you a plethora of material and then say that we will discuss this later, or say \\"just do this. You will see why later.\\" She goes into the reason for doing something before doing it.\\" - Clyde AddisonDo you have some experience developing iOS apps and wonder if this course is for you? Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this:\\"This is the best-organized course for starting Swift that I\'ve seen. The course is excellent for teaching Swift programming including vital information using Xcode, Github, Cocoapods, Stack Overflow, Alamofire, Firebase, REST APIs and all the services commonly used by app developers. They show all the ways of using Xcode and other services that took me months to learn willy nilly. Wish I had this course a year ago but even with a year of Swift experience I still found a lot of great information and helpful tips. Love all the extras the course provides especially the assets(graphics, sound files, etc) for practice projects as I\'m always taking too much time to find some assets to play with. This course understands how to teach programmers by giving them the toolsets and abilities they need to build apps. The course teaches the foundation of the language as well as skills to build your knowledge and improve your troubleshooting skills. Angela is a wonderful speaker and should do the voiceovers on everyone\'s instructional videos, seriously. :)\\" - Marcy Vernon\\"Def. an amazing and awesome class for learning iOS programming. I\'ve been coding for years and taken many programming related classes on Udemy and this is def. one of the best. The instructor walks you through all the in\'s and out\'s of developing apps for the iOS platform. Top Shelf A++ class.\\" - Mirko CukichREMEMBER\\u2026 I\'m so confident that you\'ll love this course that we\'re offering a FULL money back guarantee for 30 days!

Thank you for the great lectures.\\u00a0Andreas LackmannI really wish I had access to a course such as this four years ago when I first started dabbling with Wordpress as a hobby in my retirement. The learning process at the time, for a non-techy like me, was painstaking. Andy\'s course was the ideal step-by-step teaching method. I\'m now much more confident about starting a new affiliate marketing website.\\u00a0LeonWell delivered, well structured. Easy to follow and logical.\\u00a0Developed my own website in parallel with the course, and had it up and running within two weeks of starting. Looking forward to undertaking a couple of the course developers other courses now. Highly recommended.\\u00a0Steve LaingExcellent instructor.\\u00a0Andy is great. He used visuals for everything he say. I was able to pause him and go to my site and test my understanding in all areas that I did know. The results and excitement are fantastic.\\u00a0Esau KhanA fantastic course.\\u00a0Thank you Andy. This is a great course and it has helped me start to build my own WordPress website. I was very impressed when I had a problem with viewing my site that you took time to check for me. That shows what a great teacher you are. I have booked up another course by to and can\'t wait for more. Once again. Thank you.\\u00a0B BrownMany of the courses I\'ve been through related to learning Wordpress are either too complicated or the author doesn\'t spend enough time explaining concepts so that you can understand what\'s being said. Andy strikes a nice balance with this course in that all the modules are broken up into easily digestible pieces. I like that he takes enough time to explain each new concept or module without being repetitive or using jargon that\'s difficult to follow. I also love being able to follow along with Andy as he explains each new module as well (as opposed to just talking off of slides all the time). He literally walks you through everything, so it\'s like you\'re right there looking over his shoulder. For anyone wanting to understand all the fundamentals of Wordpress, I think you\'ll absolutely love this course. It will save you tons of time by having all this information in one place. And you\'ll even learn some additional features like setting up affiliate links (not that everyone needs to know this but I like that Andy included it so it\'s there if you ever want to know). Truly a fantastic course!\\u00a0Lance GrossSuperb Course - Extraordinary Instructor!!\\u00a0Andy\'s Wordpress for Beginners-Master Wordpress Quicky course is by far the best Wordpress course I\'ve seen. And I definitely wouldn\'t say it\'s just for beginners. I\'m not a beginner - I thought I knew Wordpress pretty well, but I learned SO MUCH MORE from this course! I\'ve always had a lot of questions about the many settings and various options in Wordpress and most courses just skip over them or tell you to check this box and move on with no explanation. I never really got my questions answered until now. Andy is very detailed in his instruction. He walks you through step by step and tells you what each setting or section is for, how it is used (or not used) and why. I got more out of Andy\'s course than any other course I\'ve ever taken. He has an extensive teaching background and it is evident in his clearly produced videos. After taking this course, you\'ll find your confidence level will soar.\\u00a0Carol","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}}]}',

The UI design choices we make have to reflect the user\\u2019s motivations, expectations, environment and possible actions.\\nAll of those things manifest themselves in the User Interface \\u2014 so what people see on the screen is usually the sum of their understanding about what this is and how it works.\\nSo what we show them has to do a hell of a job communicating what\\u2019s there for them, how it\\u2019s organized, how they get to it and what they can do with it once they do.\\nThe principles, practices and real-world techniques I\'m going to show you here are the same ones that have informed graphic design for hundreds of years.

You\'ll learn how to create and apply\\u00a0hierarchy, color, contrast, typography and gestalt principles to design appropriate visual\\u00a0cues so people know where and\\u00a0how to take action.\\nI\'ll show you how to make good visual decisions for even the most\\u00a0challenging applications, from\\u00a0simplifying complex\\u00a0visual information to designing with data.

Now featuring over 15 hours of on-demand content, including getting your design portfolio up and running online using\\u00a0 Adobe Portfolio and Behance!Welcome to the Graphic Design Bootcamp! This course has over 6,000 5-star reviews, and has been a Udemy bestseller for more than a year!Do you like to learn in a project-based environment?Do you want to learn the basics of Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign?Do you want to tackle BOTH print and web design projects?You\\u2019re in the right place! This course is for anyone who is interested in becoming a graphic designer, and especially geared towards beginners. When you enroll in this course, you will have access to over 15 hours of on-demand content, as well as the opportunity to join a private Facebook group with over 13,000 members.I move quickly through the content, since many students enjoy a quick learning pace. Prefer a more laid-back pace? Many students find that re-watching lectures or pausing the lectures during key learning points is a helpful way to digest the information.I also make use of shortcuts \\u2013 something that all great designers learn how to do to increase their productivity and maximize their workflow \\u2013 so once you enroll, be sure to download the course shortcut hotsheet: a PDF listing many of the most-used shortcut codes so that you can follow along easily and get ahead quickly.In this course I\'ll also show you how to make some of the most popular projects in the industry, like:\\u00b7 custom logos\\u00b7 business cards\\u00b7 brochures\\u00b7 flyers\\u00b7 web graphics\\u00b7 and more.What Students Are Saying About This Course:\\u00b7 \\"I have used Adobe CC for a few years now, but everything I\'ve learned I\'ve learned from doing. While some of this has been basic as I\'m already familiar with the tools, there are tricks and advice that I would have never known that make life MUCH easier (the \\"content-aware\\" fill is a game changer) and I really enjoy the pacing and manner in which he explains the tools, techniques and theory!\\" - Nikki Tetreault\\u00b7 \\"This course is good. The tutor is really nice and clear (US accent is alien to me so I sometimes find it difficult to understand - the tutor here is great, doesn\'t speak too fast & is clear, without too many colloquialisms). Enjoying the classes. Feel prepared enough for the purpose I took the course. Would definitely recommend and also do other courses by this tutor\\" - Alvira Kiss\\u00b7 \\"I started this course with little experience and thankfully I have learnt a lot throughout this course. I can\'t wait to learn more about this industry and make my mark on the world and its all thanks to this course which has kickstarted my journey!\\" - Charles Vaughn\\u00b7 \\"So far it\'s been great. I\'m a student that struggles largely in traditional school settings, the ability to pause, take notes, rewind, and move back and forth as I need has been great. The instructor has been clear and precise, and has given plenty to think about as we\'re creating files.\\" - Samantha Finn\\u00b7 \\"For a guy whove been working with photoshop for nearly 10 years Im still learning from this course.\\" - Aryne Neil CabatanWhat to Expect:We will be using Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator; the industry-standard applications for graphic design. I\'ll also review relevant terms and design practices to help you create pixel-perfect projects for print and web, with the goal to get you up and running as soon as possible so you can start your new and exciting career as a graphic designer.If you aren\'t looking to learn design for a job, don\'t worry - this is a great course for you too! Many of my students are moms looking to make fun cards or invitations, or students looking to spice up their resumes and social media graphics, and teachers looking to add some creative elements to their homework materials - the list goes on and on. Design is for everyone! And this course is, too!There is also a private Facebook group with over 13,000 students and counting, which is an awesome resource for you to take advantage of while you go through the course. The group is an excellent place to post projects, get insightful critiques, and network with other like-minded students and working professionals all over the world.All project files are included as a free download at the beginning of each section, and you are welcome to use the files however you want, or simply to follow along with the projects as you move through the lessons.As mentioned before, I cover a lot of program shortcuts in this course as well!For the most part, all of the principles you will learn in this course transcend the tools you actually use - There are students using Adobe versions from CS3 up to CC 2019, and there are even students using apps like Sketch and Pixelmator to make some of the projects in this course.If you see anything in any of the lectures that no longer apply with the software update, please let me know! I\\u2019m doing my best to keep this course up to date and continue to add value for you.Instructor Qualifications and Background:Derrick has spent his entire career in the creative arts and marketing sector.
