When Colt demonstrates the concepts, he mainly uses the simpler methods that are only compatible with browsers beside Internet Explorer. Although I hate IE as well, as developers we have no choice but to write code compatible with IE. Sure simpler methods save us time, but when the site doesn't function correctly in one of the most prominent browsers in the world, those methods become meaningless. Could you imagine the devs in YouTube ignoring to write code compatible with IE? I don't think most companies would want to create their websites that works incorrectly on IE. \n\nThose methods are useful, but when showing examples I think you should just stick to the universal methods.",

This course will definitely give one the feel of being a developer, as some of the course is out of date and one needs to research how to fix it.  The fixes are pretty easy as the student number is extremely high  (Therefore, the answers to exact project questions are usually available online or within the course comments).  One needs to realize that errors and fixing errors are commonplace for developers.  Other than the occasional issue, the course flows nicely.  Most of the concepts are basic.... very basic, but basics are what one needs and the instructor really teaches important fundamentals, along with the most common tactics in web development.  In the real world, these concepts come in handy when examining more complex websites.  However, I recommend following up with a React, Angular, or more advanced web development course to get more knowledge in web-development.  Again, great course, best course to get a full understanding of how to code from basically 0 skills.',

  'Content': "Stephen Grider is a straight-up BALLER!\n\nIm taking 3 React Udemy courses by 3 different instructors. This is by far the all-around best of the 3 React courses I experienced.\n\nThe instructor's examples are easy to understand, he doesn't waste words, and he doesn't give overly-complicated explanations or use overly-complicated example exercises, like the instructors in the other 2 courses tended to do. \n\nI was taking all 3 React courses at the same time to really nail the React system down, but I actually stopped taking the other 2 React courses half-way through each of them because they were a waste of my time. I preferred to spend my precious time rewatching and reviewing Grider's course material.\n\nI cannot say enough how amazing a teacher Stephen Grider is (no, I do not know him). You can really tell he put a ton of thought and planning into this course, and it really showed throughout.\n\nThis was without a shred of doubt, far and away the best money I've ever spent in my 41 years on this planet. \n\nYou'll see.

  'Content': "Fantastic course. I've taken several courses both on Udacity and Udemy and this has been my favorite. \n Stephen is a terrific instructor who explains concepts very well including using visuals and tons of code examples.   \nMy few critiques of the course are minor and more of a wishlist as far as future studies:\nIt would be helpful if this course provided downloadable cheatsheets that capture what we learn (including the visuals he references) so that we could quickly reference them later as opposed to trying to rewatch past videos if we forget something/want to revisit and or clarify a prior concept.  Few rather minor versioning issues (which would be expected given the constant changing nature of the React).  Redux is a tough concept, but Stephen explains it well.  Wouldn't mind a little more coverage of hooks and Redux alternatives if possible.  Also, as far as taking the course for career advancement, providing slightly more in-depth/visually appealing projects would be nice.  Such portfolio projects really shine when pushing to github as demonstration of the skills acquired.  Along the same vein: being limited to Semantic UI for CSS styling (vs more popular frameworks like BootStrap and Material UI) is also not ideal, but understandable as far as making sure React is the focus of this course.  Looking forward to trying out his Fullstack React course and perhaps also GraphQL with React.",

  'Content': "This course is unmatched in value. This is a full-scale, start to finish data science bootcamp. \n\nWhat is isn't. however, is a good course. The lessons are jumbled, poorly arranged and nervously out of date. Having spent two hours a day for 45 days attempting to decipher this course and fulfill my data science ambitions, I realize I have not at all wasted money, but I have certainly wasted time. The latter part of the course seems to be treated like an after thought, probably reflecting the completion rates of the majority of the students taking it. I have spent more time scrolling endless, unsorted Q&A sections of this course to find out why my code doesn't work, only for a note half way down by the course instructors, written 2 years ago, indicating this code is no longer compatible. This would be forgivable of course, if they provided a link to where one can find the updated module/method. None is provided. I must manually trawl through other students' panic fixes, google pages of StackOverflow just to fix a horrendously broken piece of information. Sadly, you can not even forward propagate this fix, as the rest of the modules rely on a piece of broken code. Sure, we can forgive this pedagogical error given the immense value of this course, but we cannot retrieve those hours back. If you are serious about data science, this is not the course for you. Pay General Assembly or probably the hosts of more expensive courses out there for a slightly better level of support and materials, and you may transform yourself in 45 days into a data scientist, whereas I am left with a professional qualification in using the StackOverflow search engine.",

It really gets to the point and avoid to load unecessary details. For example in probability theory I saw that multinomial distribution has been missing. I thought that as a weakness but then I understood that such details are for the individual to seek for himself.

  'Content': "Overall, the course is well suited as a first overview and introduction to the topic. However, as the course proceeds, there are definitely limitations that become apparent. \n\n1) Relevant methods are missing: Many methods that are included in other courses are missing. Interestingly, this applies even to buzzwords like Random Forest or Regularization (LASSO etc.). This is already obvious from the course overview, but it is still a bit strange.\n\n2) The course seems partially incomplete: For the deep learning cases, which are extremely interesting, the course simply stops after the model testing. There are countless questions in the Q&A section about how to recognise new images using the model. After all, that's what it's all about, and what you set up the entire model for in the first place. Why is this not covered in the course? Why not let the student classify an own handwritten number with the help of the model?\n\n3) There is a lot of repetition: Obviously, this course is not very consistent. Rather, it seems that the course is copied together from several different courses. The explanation of overfitting alone is repeated three or four times. This disturbs the flow somewhat, because it is not addressed that you have already heard this topic three times before. It is always brought up again as a new topic.\n\n4) The introduction to Python is a bit short: The introduction to Python was one of the main reasons for me to buy this course. Of course you learn a lot, however there is hardly any real introduction to the functions and methods and no general overview. What are generally the most important functions in Pandas or NumPy? For dplyr in R there are cheat sheets. I am very sure this exists for various Python packages as well. It would have been useful to go through these commands and demonstrate them with simple examples.",

It was quite contrary to the impressions I got before taking this course. So, that's a one-star. So if you had zero skills and experiences in this field, I would not recommend this course. If you still take this course, get a study buddy, or better yet a mentor. Good luck.",

I really liked that we build all 3 apps from scratch, specially that the Instructor showed & explained the process of building Express API with mongoDb which we used in our app.\n\ncons:\n1. This course is not well structured .\n2. It doesn\'t give a broad view of React Native instead focuses only on specific topics. For example, doesn\'t explain when to use expo and when to use react-native-cli for project generation, no explanation of ejecting the app from expo, no explanation of how to publish app or even how to make an apk file. Therefore, not for beginners.\n3. Not very active in answering questions in QnA (atleast not for me).\n4. No firebase, no redux. The course preview video is very old and misleading.\n\nOverall, the course felt incomplete. Even in the last video the instructor said "see you in a minute" which means that was not supposed to be the last video!',

Even though this class shows you a lot, you've only scratched the surface. It's good enough for a simple blog or business website, but if you want to do more, you should add a class that will show you that certain skill (woocommerce for example. ) \n\nThis class is one of the best WP beginner classes on Udemy. It sets a strong foundation. The instructor is fantastic. Easy to understand and is very obvious that he knows what he is doing. On top of taking a woocommerce class from another instructor, I will also be taking Andy's Intermediate class along with his security class because I think they will be fundamental in understanding and mastering WP. WP is an amazing technology that can bring anyone on to the web, nowadays, that's the bare minimum. I am really looking forward to starting the Intermediate class today.",

However, many of the instructor's 'preferences' were presented as dogma or law especially in the 'imagery section' of the course. Stating that sexualized images 'always' cheapen work just feels like a lazy thought. Undisputedly human beings are often motivated and intrigued by sexual objectives and including imagery that appeals to our sexual interests can be appropriate and effective in many settings.",

She is very laid back, down to earth and relatable in her teaching style.  Using real time videos of drawing and narration she adopts a conversational tone that feels like she\'s your personal mentor having a chat, she makes the odd mistake in her work which she corrects and uses as teaching points, which I love as it shows that even someone of her skill level makes mistakes and shows how to correct them.\nThis method of teaching is a step away from the traditional "flawless teacher" attitude that is all over education, there is nothing wrong with this method, but it is refreshing to have a teacher that is so down to earth and relatable; something that I feel, in art, is very necessary.\n\nI didn\'t expect to also get a biology lesson from this course!  Using all the muscle groups to describe how to draw the body might not be original but Christina does it in a way that makes you feel like anyone can understand and master drawing of the human figure.\n\nMy drawing is improving with every video as with each one something new slots into place.\n\nI love this course, I know I will be referring to it many times in the future and am looking forward to purchasing more of Christina\'s courses in future to support her motivational teaching style',

I was already intrigued by the PPP framework from hearing some of their team speak at an event, but it was so helpful to have them walk through the ideas and methodology in more detail, and really appreciate all the information and tools that are included in the course. Extremely generous and so inspiring! Ended the course feeling energized and also well-equipped to begin implementing this approach.",
